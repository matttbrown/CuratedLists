## Marketplaces

- [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com): Traditionally been the "bread and butter" of freelance programmers, now even the Elance is merged with Upwork. Can work out for you if you can sort through the chaos and able to separate the wheat from the chauff. Personally, I'm liking this site less and less since they first increased the commission to 20%, then sent some difficult clients on my way.
- [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com): A good freelancing site in its own niche for quick and short-term jobs with limited budgets. Unkile typical freelance portals where the client posts a requirement and freelancer bids, on Fiverr, the freelancer creates something called a "gig" or service which the client pays for and thus starts a project or contract. Despite the name, you get a lot of good projects that can continue well into long term, I can personally vouch for this site as I've made a good number of sales here.
- [FiveSquid](https://www.fivesquid.com): The British version of Fiverr, only difference is that you get paid in British Pounds instead of USD. Also, the website lacks some features compared to Fiverr (such as the ability to send a customized offer in the free membership plan, various stats about your gig, etc).
- [Guru](http://www.guru.com): Yet another freelance portal, maybe not as good as Upwork/Fiverr, but still better than freelancer.com.
- [Freelancer.com](https://www.freelancer.com): Though its the second most popular portal in the freelancing world after Upwork, there have been reports of many scammy things from here. I also don't like the fact that they want developers to pay the commission upfront, even before they are paid for their first job. You also need to be VERY careful, not to click on their shady membership adverts that trick you into handing back all your earned money to them.
- [People Per Hour](http://www.peopleperhour.com): Heard a lot about this site and the good quality of projects and clients that you usually get around here. Personally, I'm yet to make my first opening here.
- [Golance](https://golance.com): Joined this site recently, seems very promising from what I've heard on reddit, personally, I'm yet to land on a project here.
- [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/#expect-top-tier-devs): Toptal is a global network of top software engineers and designers with a hiring rate of less than 3%. Toptal works with clients to understand their project/team needs and custom-matches them with pre-screened developers and designers who join their teams on a full-time, part-time, or hourly basis.
- [/r/ForHire](http://www.reddit.com/r/ForHire): Yet another good place to find jobs, though some of their rules are way too silly and appear prejudiced. For example, I was banned from this subreddit, just because my hourly rate was "too low".
- [Pilot](https://pilot.co) - Pilot is a software platform that removes all the pain from contract work. We find work, negotiate contracts, send invoices and chase payments for hundreds of forward-looking engineers and designers around the world.
